# Data-Visualization

The primary objective of our project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of road traffic accidents using the provided dataset. By exploring the relationships and patterns within the data, we aim to
#### 1. Identify factors associated with the frequency and severity of accidents, as well as their spatial and temporal distribution.
#### 2. What are the most common contributing factors to road accidents, such as weather conditions, road types, vehicle types, and driver behavior?
#### 3. Are there any patterns or trends in the occurrence of road accidents, such as variations by time of day, day of the week, or month of the year?
#### 4. How do the characteristics of road accidents, such as severity and number of casualties, differ across different regions or jurisdictions?
